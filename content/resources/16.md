description: A student examines a small boulder of kimberlite remaining after the
  Triple-B kimberlite prospect near New Liskeard was backfilled by the propety holders
  - presumably to thwart further examination of this occurence of kimberlite intruding
  Paleoproterozoic argillite. Kimberlite is a dark, heavy, often fragmented igneous
  rock that may contain diamonds in the rock matrix. Images courtesy of Andrew Daly.
